Ear Training Game

This is a Python-based ear training game designed to help users develop their relative pitch perception, especially for differentiating microtonal intervals. 
The game presents two consecutive tones (using sine waves) and challenges you to identify both the direction (sharp/flat) and the detune amount (in cents).



This project requires Python 3 and the following non-standard libraries:
	•	numpy
	•	sounddevice
	•	readchar
